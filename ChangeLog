	* sq.h (debug): timestamping added
	(verr): debugging added for timestamping in error case
	(main): now using the _v2 interface as the legacy SQLite interface
	seems to have serious issues with busy_timeout.  If you do not
	have the _v2 interface, just remove this 3 letters from the
	source.

	* TODO: added

	* sq.h (main): timeout now set before each step(), too, such that
	it works every time, not only for the first statement.
	(main): Statement added into debugging output
	(main): Skip spaces at the start of a statement.  This also skips
	empty statements.  Previously 'sq db.sqlite ""' was an error, now
	it does just nothing.  If you want this behavior again, always end
	the statement on a ';' as 'sq db.sqlite ";"' is an error again.

	* sq.h (fetchfile): added format :fd#_#[t]_#_whatever

	* sq.h (ansiescape_string): 'echo' escape sequence fixed again,
	sigh.

	* sq.h (escape_string): "\xHH", replaced by "\0ooo" as echo might
	not know about the first sequence

	* sq.h (main): Bugfix: arg0 path \ was never considered
