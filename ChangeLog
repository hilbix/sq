	* sq.h (main): timeout now set before each step(), too, such that
	it works every time, not only for the first statement.

2009-02-16  Valentin Hilbig  <tino@zoo.03.softkill.net>

	* sq.h (fetchfile): added format :fd#_#[t]_#_whatever

	* sq.h (ansiescape_string): 'echo' escape sequence fixed again,
	sigh.

2008-05-28  Valentin Hilbig  <tino@zoo.03.softkill.net>

	* sq.h (escape_string): "\xHH", replaced by "\0ooo" as echo might
	not know about the first sequence

2007-12-20  Valentin Hilbig  <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* sq.h (main): Bugfix: arg0 path \ was never considered
