Option -d now shows the statement to execute.

Behavioral change:  Before 'sq3 test.db ""' was an error, now this is silently skipped.
However the behavior of 'sq3 test.db ;' still is the same, so if you need to fail on
an empty statement, be sure to always have a trailing ';', even on empty statements.

This change is due to 'sq3 test.db " select 1; "' previously gave an error, as the
blank after the ';' started a new, empty statement, which was not nice if you -
somehow - tried to have some formatted shell script.
