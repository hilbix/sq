Option -d now shows the statement to execute and space-trimming of commandline.

<b>Important!</b> Don't use "begin;" for write transactions, use
"begin exclusive;".  This is due to the way SQLITE prevents deadlocks
while within a transaction.  If the transaction is started
nonexclusively (without "exclusive"), the lock promotion code does not
obey timeouts and immediately fails to prevent unneccessary deadlocks.
If this is a correct behavior can be argued, however there is a way
around it: By using "begin exlcusive" for transactions which
permanently alter data.

Behavioral change: Before 'sq3 test.db ""' was an error, now this is
silently skipped.  However the behavior of 'sq3 test.db ;' still is
the same, so if you need to fail on an empty statement, be sure to
always have a trailing ';', even on empty statements.

This change is due to 'sq3 test.db " select 1; "' previously gave an
error, as the blank after the ';' started a new, empty statement,
which was not nice if you - somehow - tried to have some formatted
shell script.
