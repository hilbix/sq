Extended :fd#__ support.  This can be considered a bugfix (feature fix).

If you wanted to read more than one field with the same termination
rule, this was not possible, as, for example, several :fd0__32
parameters all defined *one*single* parameter which was set.  To be
able to create more than one parameter this way, just append
_something to it, like: :fd0__32_a :fd0__32_b and so on.
