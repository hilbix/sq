Minor bugfix removed (argv[0] for CygWin), option -l for looping added

With Option -l you can do things like
<pre>
find . -type f -print0 |
md5chk -nz |
sq3 DB 'insert into md5table ( md5, name ) values ( :fd0__32, :fd0__0 )'
</pre>

For LF use something like ":fd0__10".

To get rid of a CR in a CR LF sequence, use the trim option.  This is
activated by a 't' like ':fd0_100t' or ':fd0_t_10'.

But be careful as always, this has not yet been extensively debugged.
