Minor bugfix removed (argv[0] for CygWin), option -l for looping added

With Option -l you can do things like
<pre>
find . -type f -print0 |
md5chk -nz |
sq3 -l DB "insert into md5 ( :fd0::32, :fd0::0 )"
</pre>

For LF use something like ":fd0::10".

To get rid of a CR in a CR LF sequence, use the trim option.  This is
activated by negative values, like ':fd0,-100' or ':fd0,,-10'.

But be careful as always, this has not yet been extensively debugged.
