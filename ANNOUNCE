Option -v is for convenience use of -a, -s and -e
Option -s now can be given multiple times.
Options -b and -e added.

Option -v was added for easy shell eval purpose and needed option -e as well as multiple option -s.
For symmetry of -e, option -b has been added, too.

The new option -v sets all options exactly as how in following example:
<pre>echo eval `./sq3 -a -s"=$'" -s"' " -e"'" test.db "select 'test1',' complex string ','test2','another '' string'"`</pre>
This outputs 
<pre>eval test1=$'\040complex\040string\040' test2=$'another\040\'\040string'</pre>
