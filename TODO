Bugs and limitations:

- Commandline is too stupid.
- Tool still has too many limits.
- There is no infinite timeout.  (You can emulate with lockrun, though.)
- :fd#_.. thingie is somewhat cryptic, however I have no good idea how to do it.
- add user functions!  See below.
- here-scripts (Shell) not supported.  (read statement from stdin)

Possible functions:

pcre(r,s)	return match perl-regexp r to s
		example: pcre('|/[^?/]*$|',url)
pcre(r,s,o)	return replacement string o according of match r to s
		pcre('|(http://[^?/]*/[^?]*/thumbs/([^?]*)$|',url,'$1/$2')
digest(alg,s)	Calculate digest of s with algorithm alg
		Algorithms: md5 sha sha1 sha224 sha256 sha384 sha512
shell(s,..)	Send arguments via commandline, returns stdout.
		THIS FORKS FOR EACH RECORD!
filter(s,..)	Send arguments to stdin, read a line of answer from stdout.
		This only forks once.  No whitespace trimming is done!
math(X,op,Y)	Arbitrary precision math, calculate X op Y
		Base2, base8, base10, base16, base32, base64 and blob(=base256)
